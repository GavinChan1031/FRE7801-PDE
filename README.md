# Heston Model and its Implementation on WTI Options

This repository is created for the final project paper and relative coding for course FRE 7801: Partial Differential Equations in Finance.

## Codes

`HestonModel.ipynb` contains the first numerical implementations for the analytical solutions for Heston Model; sensitivity analysis for estimated parameters; and most importantly, model calibration.

`MonteCarloSimulation.ipynb` contains the second numberical method which is used to check whether the first method get the correct answer and check their consistency.

`GreeksPlotting.ipynb` plots the Greeks for Heston Model.
